# Auto-login-YT
This code allows you to login automatically in your yt acc (it does not work with 2 factor authentification)
You need to have these modules installed as well as nodejs:
    -npm i puppeteer
    -npm i puppeteer-extra
    -npm i puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

You can change the password in the password.js file and the email in the line 11 of the Login.js file.
With that said use it as you desire.
